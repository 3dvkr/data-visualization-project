# Data Visualization Project

## Original project scope
This project is a prototype UI to consume and transform raw data into meaningful insights and forecasting.

The original project included a form to request datasets from an Express API for different sensors. Each dataset included one data series from measurements, and second data series that was forecasted through machine learning. This added a new chart component to the page to display the new dataset.

## Current demo features
This demo displays a set of mock measurement and forecasted data on one chart for three time windows. The chart component has data-aware axes labels and scales that programmatically adjust the minima and maxima.
